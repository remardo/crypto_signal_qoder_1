# Trading System Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address issues with trade execution logic, order placement, and P&L synchronization in the trading system.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Order Types for Risk Management
**Problem**: Stop-loss and take-profit orders were being placed as MARKET orders instead of STOP_MARKET and TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET orders.

**Solution**: Updated order placement methods to use correct order types with proper parameters:
- `STOP_MARKET` for stop-loss orders
- `TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET` for take-profit orders
- Added `stopPrice` and `workingType: 'MARK_PRICE'` parameters
- Set `reduceOnly: true` for all risk management orders

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/tradeExecutionService.js`
- `src/services/executionService.js`

### 2. Leverage Handling
**Problem**: Leverage parameter was being passed in order body, which is incorrect according to BingX API.

**Solution**: 
- Removed leverage parameter from order placement methods
- Implemented separate `setLeverage` calls before placing orders
- Leverage is now properly set via the dedicated API endpoint

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/tradeExecutionService.js`
- `src/services/executionService.js`

### 3. P&L Synchronization
**Problem**: Unrealized P&L was being calculated locally instead of using real-time exchange data.

**Solution**:
- Added `syncFromExchange` method to Position model to update data from exchange
- Modified positionService to use real-time exchange data for P&L updates
- Account model now retrieves real-time P&L data from exchange for open positions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/models/Position.js`
- `src/services/positionService.js`
- `src/models/Account.js`

### 4. Break-Even Functionality
**Problem**: Missing implementation for moving stop-loss to break-even after take-profit execution.

**Solution**:
- Implemented break-even functionality in executionService
- Added order tracking and monitoring for take-profit executions
- Automatically moves stop-loss to entry price after any take-profit is filled

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/executionService.js`

## Verification

### Order Types
All risk management orders now use the correct types:
- Stop-loss orders: `STOP_MARKET`
- Take-profit orders: `TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET`

### Parameters
Orders include all required parameters:
- `stopPrice`: Price at which order should trigger
- `workingType: 'MARK_PRICE'`: Uses mark price for trigger calculation
- `reduceOnly: true`: Ensures orders only reduce position size

### P&L Accuracy
- Real-time P&L data is pulled directly from exchange
- Local calculations are only used as fallback
- Account-level P&L includes both realized and unrealized components

## Testing
The system has been verified to:
1. Place correct order types with proper parameters
2. Accurately synchronize P&L data from exchange
3. Properly handle leverage settings
4. Implement break-even functionality correctly

## Future Considerations
- Continue monitoring order execution logs to ensure no MARKET orders are incorrectly placed for risk management
- Verify that all P&L calculations match exchange data
- Monitor break-even functionality in live trading conditions
